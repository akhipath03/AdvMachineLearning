        <h3>Global Food Systems and Gas Emissions</h3>
        <p>
          My final project in my data visualization class aimed to "show the
          whole story" of global food systems and their contribution to gas
          emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created an HTML website featuring multiple interactive
          visualizations using Tableau. The project delved into the relationship
          between global food systems and gas emissions, presenting the impact
          at both country and food-specific levels.
        </p>
        <p>The visualizations included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choropleth map showing greenhouse gas emissions by country.</li>
          <li>
            Stacked bar chart highlighting emissions from all stages of food
            production per food.
          </li>
          <li>Bar chart categorizing emissions by food groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After formatting and adding an introduction and conclusion for context
          and main takeaways, I enhanced the user experience with a CSS
          stylesheet.

        <h3>Gradient Boosting Lowess vs eXtreme Gradient Boosting Library</h3>
        <p>
          Created a class implementing the Gradient Boosting concept based on
          the locally weighted regression method (Lowess class), allowing a
          user-prescribed number of boosting steps. The class includes
          mainstream useful options such as "fit," "is_fitted," and "predict"
          methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demonstrated applications with real data for regression, 10-fold
          cross-validations, and compared the effect of different scalers
          including the "StandardScaler," "MinMaxScaler," and the
          "QuantileScaler." In the case of the "Concrete" dataset, determined a
          choice of hyperparameters that yielded lower Mean Squared Errors
          (MSEs) for the implemented method compared to the eXtreme Gradient
          Boosting library.

        <h3>KNN Regressor using USearch Library</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a KNN Regressor using the USearch Library in Python. The KNN
          Regressor is implemented to predict the labels of data points based on
          the labels of their nearest neighbors. The implementation allows for a
          user-defined number of nearest neighbors (k).
        </p>
        <p>
          Demonstrated the performance of the KNN Regressor using the iris
          dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Preprocessed the
          data, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluated the
          model's accuracy across varying values of k.
